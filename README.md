# 📌 Networking App - World News

This app was developed as part of the **Android Basics: Networking** course, a module in the **Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree** program.

## 📖 Project Overview

The goal was to create an app that **connects to the Internet** to provide news articles on a topic of user’s choice. The goal is to create a News Feed app which gives a user **regularly updated news from the Internet related to a particular topic, person, or location.**

## ✅ Requirements Followed

The app must include the following:

 ✔ Main screen which displays multiple user stories
  - Each list item on the main screen displays relevant text and information about the story.
  - Stories shown on the main screen updates properly whenever new news data is fetched from the API.
  - Clicking on a story uses an intent to open the story in the user browser.       
✔ Connecting to an API: App queries the content.guardianapis.com api to fetch news stories related to the topic using api key.      
✔ Parsing the JSON response: The JSON response is parsed correctly, and relevant information is stored in the app.             
✔ Handling error cases gracefully     
- The app checks whether the device is connected to the internet and responds appropriately.               
- Shows appropriate message for a bad server response or lack of server response.             
✔ Updating information regularly: When there is no data to display, the app shows a default textview that informs the user.            
✔ Using an AsyncTask      
✔ Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle: Networking operations are done using a Loader rather than an AsyncTask.                
✔ Use Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to the URL
